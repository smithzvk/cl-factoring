;; @\section{Introduction}

;; This library presents a set of algorithms for computing integer
;; factorizations.  An interface is provided that takes an integer and will
;; return a list of prime numbers such that, when multiplied together, will
;; result in the original number.

;; There is no magic sauce here or mathematical breakthroughs; the time
;; complexities of each algorithm is exponential.

;; @\section{Special Purpose Methods}

;; In this section we present algorithms that perform integer factorization for
;; composite numbers where we know some extra information about them.  This
;; contains several interesting problems, chief among them is when we know that
;; the problem contains composites whose prime factors are all (or are all but
;; one) small integers.  This set of numbers contains most of the numbers that
;; users encounter in everyday life with the notable exception of the numbers
;; used in cryptography.

;; @\subsection{Trial Division}

;; @The <<trial-division>> algorithm is given as a simple method of performing
;; factorizations.  This algorithm is O(sqrt(n)/2), and about the most naive
;; method one can conceive of.  It is still affective in many cases, though we
;; find that its performance is superseded by the Monte Carlo methods introduced
;; later.

;; @\subsection{Pollard's Rho Method}

;; @Although the complexity has not been proven, this method appears to work in
;; some $O(n^{\frac 1 4} {\rm PolyLog}(n))$ making it assymptotically superior
;; to trial division and much faster in practice (this should be really tested,
;; particularly with a prime sieve in place).

;; the prime factors of the numbers.  The complexity is purely a function of the
